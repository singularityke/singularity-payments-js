# Singularity Payments

**A comprehensive, developer-friendly M-Pesa SDK that makes mobile payments integration effortless.**

Singularity Payments is a modern TypeScript/JavaScript SDK built on top of [Safaricom's Daraja API](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/) that simplifies M-Pesa integration for developers. Whether you're building an e-commerce platform, a SaaS application, or any service that requires mobile payments in Kenya, this SDK provides everything you need.

## Why Singularity Payments?

While the [Daraja API](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/APIs) is powerful, integrating it directly comes with several challenges:

## **Type Safety First**

Built with TypeScript from the ground up, you get full IntelliSense support and catch errors before they reach production. No more guessing API parameters or dealing with cryptic runtime errors.

```typescript
//  Type-safe - your IDE will guide you
const result = await client.stkPush({
  amount: 1000,
  phoneNumber: "254712345678",
  accountReference: "ORDER-123",
  transactionDesc: "Payment for order",
});

//  TypeScript catches mistakes instantly
const result = await client.stkPush({
  amount: "1000", // Error: amount must be a number
  phone: "254712345678", // Error: unknown property 'phone'
});
```

## **Simplified Authentication**

No need to manually handle OAuth tokens, token refresh, or authentication flows. The SDK manages all of this automatically.

```typescript
// With Singularity Payments - authentication handled automatically
const client = new MpesaClient({
  consumerKey: process.env.MPESA_KEY,
  consumerSecret: process.env.MPESA_SECRET,
});

await client.stkPush({
  /* ... */
}); // Just works!

// Without SDK - manual token management required
const token = await getOAuthToken();
const headers = { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` };
// Handle token expiry, refresh logic, etc.
```

## **Intuitive API Design**

Clean, modern API that follows JavaScript/TypeScript conventions. No need to study complex Daraja documentation for hours.
